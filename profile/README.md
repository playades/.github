## Hello! We are Playades 👋


🙋‍ Our mission is to improve current tools and artistic ways to support inclusion in STEM, using cutting-edge AI technologies that can give voice in order to empower women in STEM, even when they couldn't stand up for themselves in their time of history.

🌈 We accept anybody that wants to contribute to our way of improving things.
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
