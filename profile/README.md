## Hello! We are Playades 👋

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 We are a group of four. With very varied knowledge: programming, artificial intelligence, art, astronomy, engineering...

🙋‍ Our mission is to improve current tools and artistic ways to support inclusion in STEM, using cutting-edge AI technologies that can give voice in order to empower women in STEM, even when they couldn't stand up for themselves in their time of history. As well as publicize space missions for the whole world and help the new generations of young people who want to study science.

🌈 We accept anybody that wants to contribute to our way of improving things.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
